title: "Knowledge Base"
description: "Give your agent product knowledge"
---

Add content your agent can reference when answering questions.

## Sources

| Source | Best for | Updates |
|--------|----------|---------|
| [Files](/files) | PDFs, manuals, docs | Manual re-upload |
| [Website](/website) | Public docs, help centers | Manual re-crawl |
| [Notion](/notion) | Internal wikis, frequently updated content | Live (always current) |

## How it Works

1. User asks a question
2. Crow searches your knowledge base for relevant content
3. Agent uses that content to formulate an accurate answer

This is called **RAG** (Retrieval-Augmented Generation).

## Combining Sources

Use multiple sources together:

- **Files** for product manuals
- **Website** for your public documentation  
- **Notion** for internal procedures
