description: "Give your agent knowledge about your product"

The Knowledge Base is where you provide your AI agent with information about your product. The more relevant content you add, the better your agent can help users.

---

## How It Works

When a user asks a question, Crow searches your knowledge base to find relevant information. This process is called **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**:

1. **User asks a question** — "How do I reset my password?"
2. **Crow searches** — Finds relevant content from your uploaded documents, website, or Notion
3. **Agent responds** — Uses the retrieved information to provide an accurate answer

---

## Knowledge Sources

Crow supports three types of knowledge sources:

  <Card title="Files" icon="file" href="/files">
    Upload documents like PDFs, Word docs, spreadsheets, and more.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Website" icon="globe" href="/website">
    Automatically crawl and index your website content.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Notion" icon="book" href="/notion">
    Connect your Notion workspace for dynamic content access.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Choosing the Right Source

| Source | Best For | Updates |
|--------|----------|---------|
| **Files** | PDFs, manuals, static documentation | Re-upload when content changes |
| **Website** | Public-facing docs, help centers, blog posts | Re-crawl to update |
| **Notion** | Internal docs, wikis, frequently updated content | Always current (live connection) |

## Best Practices

### Keep Content Focused
Upload content that's relevant to user questions. Support docs, FAQs, and product guides work great. Avoid uploading unrelated internal documents.

### Update Regularly
When your product changes, update your knowledge base. Outdated information leads to incorrect answers.

### Test After Adding Content
After adding new content, test your agent in the Sandbox to ensure it can find and use the information correctly.

### Combine Sources
You can use multiple sources together. For example:
- **Files** for product manuals and guides
- **Website** for your public documentation
- **Notion** for internal policies and procedures
