description: "Monitor conversations and agent performance"
---

The Activity page gives you visibility into all conversations your AI agent has with users. Track conversations, debug issues, and understand how your agent is performing.

---

## Activity Overview

The Activity page shows all conversations in a two-panel layout:

- **Left panel** — List of conversations with filters
- **Right panel** — Detailed view of the selected conversation

---

## Conversation List

The left panel displays all conversations with:

| Info | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Conversation ID** | Unique identifier for the conversation |
| **Preview** | First message from the user |
| **Timestamp** | When the conversation occurred |
| **Status** | Success, error, or other states |

Click any conversation to view its details in the right panel.

---

## Filtering Conversations

Use filters to find specific conversations:

### Date Range
Select a start and end date to view conversations within a time period.

### Status
Filter by conversation outcome:
- **Success** — Conversation completed normally
- **Error** — An error occurred during the conversation

### Message Count
Filter by number of messages in the conversation.

### Search
Search for specific text within conversations.

---

## Conversation Details

When you select a conversation, the right panel shows three tabs:

### Chat Tab

View the conversation as it appeared to the user:
- User messages (right side)
- Agent responses (left side)
- Timestamps for each message
- Tool calls and their results
- Agent's reasoning process (when applicable)

### Details Tab

Metadata about the conversation:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Conversation ID** | Unique identifier |
| **Start time** | When the conversation began |
| **End time** | When the conversation ended |
| **Message count** | Total messages exchanged |
| **Token usage** | Tokens consumed |
| **Model** | AI model used |
| **Status** | Final conversation status |
| **Cost** | Estimated cost (if enabled) |

### Traces Tab

Technical debugging information:
- Raw trace data from the AI model
- Detailed execution timeline
- Useful for debugging complex issues

---

## Understanding Tool Calls

In the Chat tab, you'll see when your agent used tools:

```
🔧 Calling: getOrderStatus
   Parameters: {"orderId": "ORD-12345"}

✅ Result: {"status": "shipped", "tracking": "1Z999..."}
```

This shows:
- Which tool was called
- What parameters were sent
- What response was received

---

## Common Patterns to Look For

### Successful Conversations
- User asks a question
- Agent retrieves relevant information (from knowledge base or tools)
- Agent provides a helpful response
- User is satisfied

### Tool Usage Issues
- Agent attempts to use a tool
- Tool returns an error
- Agent may try alternative approaches or apologize

### Knowledge Gaps
- User asks about something not in your knowledge base
- Agent indicates it doesn't have that information
- Opportunity to add content to your knowledge base

---

## Using Activity for Improvement

### Identify Common Questions

Look for patterns in user questions:
- Frequently asked questions → Add to knowledge base
- Repeated tool usage → Ensure tools are working well
- Common confusion → Improve system prompt

### Spot Issues Early

Monitor for:
- Error conversations
- Tool failures
- Unhelpful responses

### Measure Performance

Track over time:
- Conversation volume
- Success rates
- Tool usage patterns
- Token consumption
