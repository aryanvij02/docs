Connect your website to automatically crawl and index your public content, making it searchable by your AI agent.

---

## How It Works

1. **Enter your URL** — Provide the root URL of your website or documentation site
2. **Crow crawls** — Automatically discovers and visits pages on your site
3. **Content is indexed** — Text is extracted, chunked, and stored for search
4. **Agent can reference** — Your agent uses this content to answer user questions

## Setting Up Website Ingestion

### Enter Your Website URL

In the Website section of Knowledge Base, enter the full URL of your site:

```
https://docs.yourcompany.com
```

or

```
https://yourcompany.com/help
```

### Start Ingestion

Click the **Ingest** button to begin crawling. The process runs in the background, so you can navigate away.

---

## What Gets Crawled

Crow will crawl pages that are:
- Publicly accessible (no login required)
- Linked from your starting URL
- On the same domain

### Good Candidates
- Documentation sites
- Help centers
- FAQ pages
- Blog posts
- Product pages

### Not Crawled
- Password-protected pages
- Pages blocked by robots.txt
- External links (other domains)
- Dynamic content requiring JavaScript interaction

---

## Viewing Status

Once ingested, you'll see a confirmation showing your website URL with a checkmark. This indicates the content has been successfully indexed.

---

## Re-Indexing Your Website

When your website content changes, you'll want to re-index:

1. Navigate to **Knowledge Base > Website**
2. Enter your website URL again
3. Click **Ingest** to start a fresh crawl

<Warning>
Re-indexing replaces the previous content. Make sure your website is accessible before re-indexing.
</Warning>

---

## Best Practices

### Use Your Documentation Site
If you have a separate documentation site (like `docs.yourcompany.com`), use that URL for more focused content.

### Keep Content Updated
Re-index your website whenever you make significant content changes to keep your agent's knowledge current.

### Check Accessibility
Ensure the pages you want indexed don't require authentication and are accessible from the public internet.

---

## Troubleshooting

### Pages Not Being Indexed
- Verify the URL is correct and publicly accessible
- Check if pages are blocked by robots.txt
- Ensure pages are linked from the starting URL

### Old Content Still Appearing
- Re-index your website to refresh the content
- Wait for the indexing process to complete

### Agent Can't Find Website Content
- Confirm the ingestion completed successfully
- Test with specific questions in the Sandbox
- Check if the content is on a page that was crawled
