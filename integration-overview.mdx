Integrations extend your AI agent's capabilities by connecting it to external APIs and services. This allows your agent to take actions, fetch data, and interact with your systems.

## Integration Options

Crow supports two types of integrations:

## OpenAPI vs MCP

| Feature | OpenAPI | MCP |
|---------|---------|-----|
| **Best for** | REST APIs you control | Third-party services, complex integrations |
| **Setup** | Upload a spec file | Connect to a server URL |
| **Authentication** | API Key, Bearer, JWT Forward | Varies by server |
| **Flexibility** | Any REST API | Pre-built integrations |

### When to Use OpenAPI

- You have a REST API with an OpenAPI/Swagger specification
- You want your agent to call endpoints on your backend
- You need to authenticate requests with API keys or tokens
- You want to forward user identity to your API

### When to Use MCP

- You want to connect third-party services (like Notion)
- You're using pre-built MCP servers
- The service provides an MCP endpoint
- You need real-time, bidirectional communication

## How Integrations Work

1. **Configure the integration** — Upload an OpenAPI spec or connect an MCP server
2. **Select tools** — Choose which operations/tools your agent can use (in Actions)
3. **Agent uses tools** — When relevant, your agent calls these tools to help users
4. **Results returned** — The tool response is used to formulate the agent's answer
