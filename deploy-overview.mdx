Once you've configured your agent, it's time to deploy it to your website. The Deploy page provides everything you need to get your widget live.

---

## Deployment Overview

Deploying Crow involves:

1. **Embed the script** — Add a script tag to your website
2. **Configure security** — Set up identity verification (optional)
3. **Go live** — Your users can start chatting

---

## Embed Script

The Deploy page shows your unique embed code:

```html
<script
  src="https://widget.usecrow.ai/crow-widget.js"
  data-product-id="your-product-id"
></script>
```

### Adding to Your Website

Copy the script and add it to your website:

**HTML**
```html
<!-- Add before </body> -->
<script
  src="https://widget.usecrow.ai/crow-widget.js"
  data-product-id="your-product-id"
></script>
```

**React / Next.js**
```jsx
import Script from 'next/script'

export default function Layout({ children }) {
  return (
    <>
      {children}
      <Script
        src="https://widget.usecrow.ai/crow-widget.js"
        data-product-id="your-product-id"
        strategy="afterInteractive"
      />
    </>
  )
}
```

For more detailed integration instructions, see the [Embed Widget Guide](/embed-widget).

## Security Key

The Security Key is used for identity verification. This allows you to authenticate users so the agent knows who they are.

### Viewing Your Key

Your security key is hidden by default. Click the eye icon to reveal it.

### Using the Key

Use this key on your backend to sign JWT tokens for identity verification. Never expose this key in client-side code.

For implementation details, see the [Identity Verification Guide](/identity-verification).

<Warning>
Keep your security key secret. If compromised, regenerate it immediately from the Crow Dashboard.
</Warning>
