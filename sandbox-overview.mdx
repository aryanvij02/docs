The Sandbox is your live testing environment where you configure your AI agent's behavior and preview how it responds to users in real-time.

---

## Agent Configuration

### Agent Name

Set a display name for your agent. This name appears in the chat widget header and helps users identify who they're talking to.

### System Prompt (Instructions)

The system prompt defines your agent's personality, knowledge boundaries, and behavior. This is where you tell your agent:
- What it should know about your product
- How it should respond to users
- What topics it should or shouldn't discuss
- Any specific guidelines or tone preferences

---

## Live Preview

The right side of the Sandbox shows a live preview of your chat widget. As you make changes to your agent's configuration, you can immediately test how it responds.

The preview widget:
- Streams responses in real-time
- Shows the exact appearance users will see
- Allows you to test different conversation scenarios

## Writing Effective System Prompts

A well-crafted system prompt is crucial for a helpful AI agent. Here are some tips:

### Be Specific About Your Product
```
You are a support agent for Acme Software, a project management tool
for remote teams. Our main features include task boards, time tracking,
and team chat.
```

### Define the Tone
```
Be friendly and professional. Use simple language and avoid technical
jargon unless the user demonstrates technical knowledge.
```

### Set Boundaries
```
Only answer questions about Acme Software. If asked about competitors
or unrelated topics, politely redirect the conversation to how you can
help with our product.
```

### Include Key Information
```
Our pricing: Free tier (up to 5 users), Pro ($10/user/month),
Enterprise (contact sales). Free trial is 14 days.
```

### Handle Edge Cases
```
If you don't know the answer, say so honestly and offer to connect
the user with our support team at support@acme.com.
```

## Best Practices

| Do | Don't |
|---|---|
| Keep instructions clear and concise | Write overly long prompts |
| Test with real user questions | Assume the first prompt is perfect |
| Update as your product evolves | Set and forget |
| Include specific product details | Be vague about capabilities |
