Connect MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers to extend your AI agent with powerful integrations. MCP is a standard protocol that enables AI agents to interact with external tools and services.

---

## What is MCP?

Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard for connecting AI models to external data sources and tools. MCP servers provide a standardized way for your agent to:

- Access external services
- Execute tools and actions
- Retrieve contextual information

---

## Connecting an MCP Server

### Step 1: Get Server Details

You'll need:
- **Server URL** — The HTTP/HTTPS endpoint of the MCP server
- **Transport Protocol** — How to communicate (Streamable HTTP or SSE)
- **Headers** (optional) — Any authentication headers required

### Step 2: Add the Server

1. Go to **Integration > MCP Servers**
2. Click **Add Server**
3. Fill in the connection details:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Server Name** | A friendly name (e.g., "my-api-server") |
| **Server URL** | The MCP endpoint URL |
| **Transport** | Streamable HTTP (recommended) or SSE |
| **Headers** | Optional auth headers in `Key: Value` format |

### Step 3: Test Connection

Click **Test Connection** to verify the server is reachable and responding correctly.

### Step 4: Save

Once the connection test passes, save the server configuration.

## Transport Protocols

### Streamable HTTP (Recommended)

The modern transport protocol for MCP. Use this unless you have a specific reason to use SSE.

### SSE (Server-Sent Events)

Legacy transport protocol. Some older MCP servers may only support SSE.

## Managing Connected Servers

### View Connected Servers

All connected servers appear in a list showing:
- Server name
- Connection status
- Number of available tools
- Enable/disable toggle

### Enable/Disable Servers

Toggle a server on or off without removing it. Disabled servers won't be available to your agent.

### View Available Tools

Click the expand arrow on any server to see its available tools. Each tool shows:
- Tool name
- Description of what it does

### Edit Server

Click the edit button to modify:
- Server URL
- Transport protocol
- Headers

### Delete Server

Remove a server entirely by clicking the delete button.

---

## Configuring Tools

After connecting a server, you can fine-tune which tools your agent can use:

1. Go to **Actions > MCP Servers**
2. Find your server in the list
3. Expand to see individual tools
4. Toggle specific tools on or off

This gives you granular control over what your agent can do.

---

## Pre-Built Integrations

Crow includes pre-built support for popular services:

### Notion
Connect your Notion workspace via **Knowledge Base > Notion**. This uses MCP under the hood to provide real-time access to your Notion content.

### Coming Soon
- Slack
- GitHub
- Google Drive

## Building Custom MCP Servers

If you want to build your own MCP server to expose custom tools:

1. Implement the MCP protocol specification
2. Host your server at a publicly accessible URL
3. Add the server URL in Crow

MCP servers can be built in any language that supports HTTP.

---

## Best Practices

### Use Descriptive Names
Name your servers clearly so you can identify them later:
- Good: `customer-data-api`, `order-management`
- Bad: `server1`, `test`

### Secure Your Endpoints
- Use HTTPS for all MCP server URLs
- Include authentication headers when required
- Don't expose sensitive operations unnecessarily

### Test After Connecting
Verify in the Sandbox that your agent can discover and use the MCP tools correctly.

### Monitor for Changes
If your MCP server adds or removes tools, Crow will discover changes automatically when tools are fetched.

---

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Test Failed
- Verify the server URL is correct
- Check that the server is running and accessible
- Ensure any required headers are included
- Try the other transport protocol

### Tools Not Appearing
- Expand the server to trigger tool discovery
- Check server logs for errors
- Verify the server implements tool listing correctly

### Agent Not Using MCP Tools
- Enable the server in the MCP servers list
- Enable specific tools in Actions
- Test with queries that should trigger the tools
