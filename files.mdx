## Uploading Files

### Drag and Drop
Simply drag files from your computer and drop them into the upload area.

### Click to Browse
Click the upload area to open a file browser and select files.

### Multiple Files
You can upload multiple files at once. Each file is processed independently.

---

## Visual Processing

When uploading PDFs, you can enable **Visual Processing** by checking the box before upload.

### What Visual Processing Does
- Extracts text from images within PDFs
- Reads charts and tables more accurately
- Understands document layouts better

### When to Use It
Enable visual processing when your documents contain:
- Screenshots or diagrams
- Complex tables
- Scanned documents
- Charts and graphs

<Warning>
Visual processing takes longer than standard text extraction. Only enable it when your documents contain visual elements.
</Warning>

## Upload Progress

After uploading, you'll see a progress card showing:

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Queued** | File is waiting to be processed |
| **Processing** | File is being read and indexed |
| **Complete** | File is ready and searchable |
| **Failed** | An error occurred (check the error message) |

For PDFs, you'll also see page-by-page progress (e.g., "Page 15 of 42").

## Managing Documents

### Delete Documents
Click the delete button next to any document to remove it from your knowledge base. This action cannot be undone.

## Best Practices

### File Size
- Small to medium files (under 50MB) process fastest
- Very large files may take several minutes

### Content Quality
- Ensure documents contain searchable text (not scanned images without OCR)
- Well-structured documents with clear headings work best
- Remove unnecessary pages (cover pages, blank pages) before upload

### Organization
- Use descriptive filenames so you can identify documents later
- Upload related content together for easier management

---

## Troubleshooting

### File Won't Upload
- Check that the file format is supported
- Ensure the file isn't corrupted
- Try a different browser if issues persist

### Processing Failed
- The file may be password-protected (remove protection and re-upload)
- The file may be corrupted (try re-creating or re-exporting)
- Very large files may timeout (try splitting into smaller files)

### Agent Can't Find Content
- Wait for processing to complete (check status)
- Test specific questions in the Sandbox
- Ensure the content is in a searchable format
