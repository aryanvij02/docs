User suggestions are clickable buttons that appear above the chat input, giving users one-tap access to common actions.

## Two Types

| Type | Set By | Persists |
|------|--------|----------|
| **Page-level** | Host app via `window.crow()` | Yes — reappears after each response |
| **Agent-driven** | Agent via `suggest_actions` tool | No — clears when user sends a message |

## Page-Level Suggestions

Use `window.crow('setSuggestedActions', [...])` to set persistent buttons for the current page. These reappear after every agent response.

```js
// Show different buttons per page
window.crow('setSuggestedActions', [
  { label: 'Enrich contacts', message: 'Enrich owner contacts for these leads' },
  { label: 'Export', message: 'Export this list to CSV' },
]);

// Clear suggestions
window.crow('setSuggestedActions', []);
```

Each suggestion has:
- **label** — Button text shown to the user
- **message** — Text sent to the agent when clicked

### Per-Page Example (Next.js)

```jsx
import { useRouter } from 'next/router';
import { useEffect } from 'react';

function CrowSetup() {
  const router = useRouter();

  useEffect(() => {
    const setSuggestions = () => {
      if (!window.crow) {
        setTimeout(setSuggestions, 200);
        return;
      }

      if (router.pathname === '/leads') {
        window.crow('setSuggestedActions', [
          { label: 'Enrich contacts', message: 'Enrich owner contacts' },
          { label: 'Add to list', message: 'Add these results to a new list' },
        ]);
      } else if (router.pathname.startsWith('/myList')) {
        window.crow('setSuggestedActions', [
          { label: 'Export', message: 'Export this list to CSV' },
        ]);
      }
    };

    setSuggestions();
  }, [router.pathname]);

  return null;
}
```

## Agent-Driven Suggestions

The agent can show buttons on demand by calling the `suggest_actions` tool. Add instructions to your agent's system prompt telling it when to offer buttons:

```
Before running any enrichment, confirm the cost with suggest_actions buttons:
- "Yes, proceed (3 credits)"
- "Cancel"
```

The agent calls `suggest_actions` with an array of `{ label, message }` objects. These buttons clear automatically when the user sends their next message.

## Dashboard Config

You can also set **initial suggestions** (shown before the user types anything) from the dashboard under **Agent > Suggestions**. These are stored in your product config and appear on widget load.
