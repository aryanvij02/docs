Connect your Notion workspace to give your AI agent access to your pages, databases, and documentation stored in Notion.

---

## How It Works

Unlike file uploads or website crawling, the Notion integration provides a **live connection** to your workspace. This means:

- Your agent accesses Notion content in real-time
- Changes in Notion are immediately available
- No need to manually sync or re-index

---

## Connecting Notion

### Step 1: Start the Connection

Click the **Connect Notion** button in the Notion section of Knowledge Base. This opens a popup window.

### Step 2: Authorize Access

In the popup, you'll see Notion's authorization screen:
1. Select your workspace (if you have multiple)
2. Choose which pages/databases to share with Crow
3. Click **Allow access**

### Step 3: Confirmation

Once authorized, you'll see:
- A green status indicator showing "Connected"
- Your workspace name displayed
- The connection is now active

## What Your Agent Can Do

With Notion connected, your agent can:

| Capability | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Search pages** | Find relevant content across your workspace |
| **Read content** | Access page content and database entries |
| **Answer questions** | Use Notion content to respond to users |

---

## Managing the Connection

### View Connection Status
The Notion page shows your current connection status:
- **Connected** (green) — Workspace is linked and accessible
- **Disconnected** — No workspace connected

### Open Notion
Click **Open Notion** to go directly to your connected workspace.

### Disconnect
To remove the connection, click **Disconnect**. This revokes Crow's access to your Notion workspace.

<Warning>
Disconnecting will prevent your agent from accessing any Notion content. Make sure this is intentional before disconnecting.
</Warning>

---

## Configuring Notion Tools

After connecting Notion, you can fine-tune which Notion capabilities your agent has access to:

1. Go to **Actions > Notion**
2. View the available Notion tools
3. Toggle individual tools on or off

This lets you control exactly what your agent can do with your Notion workspace.

## Best Practices

### Share Relevant Pages
When authorizing, only share pages and databases that are relevant for customer support. You don't need to share your entire workspace.

### Organize Content
Well-organized Notion content helps your agent find information faster. Use clear page titles and organized databases.

### Keep Content Updated
Since the connection is live, any updates you make in Notion are immediately available to your agent.

---

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Failed
- Ensure popups are allowed in your browser
- Try the connection again
- Check that you have permission to authorize apps in your Notion workspace

### Agent Can't Find Notion Content
- Verify the connection is active (green status)
- Check that the relevant pages were shared during authorization
- Re-connect if needed to update page access

### Need to Change Shared Pages
To modify which pages are shared:
1. Disconnect the current connection
2. Reconnect and select different pages during authorization
