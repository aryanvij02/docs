Actions are capabilities you enable for your agent. Go to **Actions** in the dashboard to manage them.

## Types

| Type | Source | Example |
|------|--------|---------|
| **API Tools** | Your OpenAPI spec | `getOrderStatus`, `createTicket` |
| **MCP Tools** | Connected MCP servers | Notion search, database queries |
| **Workflows** | You define them | Onboarding flow, return request |

## Enabling Actions

1. **API Tools** — Check/uncheck individual endpoints from your OpenAPI spec
2. **MCP Tools** — Toggle entire servers or individual tools
3. **Workflows** — Enable/disable specific flows

## How the Agent Decides

The agent automatically chooses tools based on:
- The user's question
- Tool names and descriptions
- Required parameters

Good tool descriptions → better tool selection.

## Best Practices

- **Start small** — Enable only what's needed, expand later
- **Test in Sandbox** — Verify tools work before deploying
- **Clear descriptions** — Help the agent understand when to use each tool
