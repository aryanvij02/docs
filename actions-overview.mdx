Actions determine what your AI agent can do beyond answering questions. This is where you enable and configure the tools available to your agent.

---

## What Are Actions?

Actions are the capabilities you give your agent. When a user asks something that requires taking action (like checking an order status or creating a ticket), your agent uses these tools to help.

---

## Types of Actions

Crow supports three types of actions:

### API Tools (OpenAPI)

Operations from your OpenAPI specification. These call your REST API endpoints.

**Example tools:**
- `getOrderStatus` — Look up an order
- `createTicket` — Create a support ticket
- `getAccount` — Retrieve account details

[Set up OpenAPI integration →](/openapi)

### MCP Tools

Tools from connected MCP servers. These interact with external services.

**Example tools:**
- Notion search and read operations
- Custom database queries
- Third-party service integrations

[Connect MCP servers →](/mcp-servers)

### Workflows (Journeys)

Guided, multi-step processes you define. These walk users through complex tasks.

**Example workflows:**
- New user onboarding
- Troubleshooting flow
- Return request process

[Create workflows →](/workflows)

## Configuring Actions

### Accessing the Actions Page

Go to **Actions** in the sidebar to see all available tools organized by type.

### Enabling/Disabling Tools

Each section has toggles to control which tools your agent can use:

1. **API Tools** — Check/uncheck individual endpoints
2. **MCP Servers** — Toggle entire servers or individual tools
3. **Workflows** — Enable/disable specific journeys

### Select All / Deselect All

Use the quick toggle to enable or disable all tools in a section at once.

## How the Agent Uses Actions

When a user asks a question:

1. **Agent analyzes** the request
2. **Identifies relevant tools** based on the question
3. **Executes the tool** if needed
4. **Uses the result** to formulate a response

The agent automatically decides when to use tools based on the user's question and the tool descriptions.

---

## Best Practices

### Start Conservative
Begin with a limited set of tools and expand as needed. Too many tools can confuse the agent.

### Use Descriptive Names
Tool names and descriptions help the agent understand when to use them. Clear descriptions lead to better tool selection.

### Test Thoroughly
After enabling tools, test in the Sandbox with realistic user questions to verify the agent uses them correctly.

### Review Regularly
As your product evolves, review which actions are enabled. Disable tools that are no longer relevant.

---

## Tool Visibility

When tools are enabled, they appear to your agent as available capabilities. The agent sees:

- Tool name
- Description
- Required parameters
- What the tool returns

This information helps the agent decide when and how to use each tool.
