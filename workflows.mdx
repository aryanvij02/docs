Workflows (also called Journeys) are guided, multi-step processes that help users complete complex tasks. They provide structure to conversations and ensure important steps aren't missed.

---

## What Are Workflows?

A workflow is a predefined sequence of steps that guides users through a process. Instead of free-form conversation, workflows provide a structured experience.

**Example workflows:**
- **Onboarding** — Walk new users through account setup
- **Troubleshooting** — Guide users through diagnostic steps
- **Returns** — Collect all required information for a return request
- **Feedback** — Gather structured feedback with specific questions

---

## How Workflows Work

1. **User triggers the workflow** — By asking something that matches the workflow's description
2. **Agent starts the journey** — Presents the first step to the user
3. **User completes steps** — Responds to each prompt in sequence
4. **Agent guides progress** — Moves through steps, optionally calling tools
5. **Workflow completes** — User has completed all steps

Users can exit a workflow at any time if they want to ask something else.

## Creating a Workflow

### Step 1: Open the Workflow Builder

Go to **Actions** and find the **Workflows** section. Click **Create Journey** to open the builder.

### Step 2: Define the Basics

| Field | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **Name** | Short, descriptive name | "New Customer Onboarding" |
| **Description** | When the agent should use this workflow | "Use when a new user needs help getting started with the product" |

The description is crucial — it tells the agent when to initiate this workflow.

### Step 3: Add Steps

Each step has:

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| **Step text** | What to ask or tell the user |
| **Tool (optional)** | An action to execute during this step |

Example steps for an onboarding workflow:
1. "Welcome! Let's get you set up. What's your company name?"
2. "Great! How many team members will be using the product?"
3. "What's your primary use case?" (Tool: `createAccount`)

### Step 4: Save the Workflow

Click **Save** to create the workflow. It will appear in your workflows list.

## Managing Workflows

### View All Workflows

The Workflows section shows all your journeys with:
- Name and description
- Number of steps
- Enable/disable toggle
- Edit and delete buttons

### Enable/Disable

Toggle a workflow on or off. Disabled workflows won't be triggered by the agent.

### Edit

Click the edit button to modify:
- Name and description
- Add, remove, or reorder steps
- Change step text or tools

### Delete

Remove a workflow entirely. This action cannot be undone.

---

## Writing Good Workflows

### Clear Entry Points

Write descriptions that clearly indicate when the workflow should trigger:

- Good: "Use when a customer wants to request a refund for an order"
- Bad: "Refund workflow"

### Logical Step Progression

Order steps in a way that makes sense:
1. Gather context first (what's the issue?)
2. Collect required information (order number, reason)
3. Take action (process the request)
4. Confirm completion (provide next steps)

### Conversational Tone

Write step text as natural conversation:

- Good: "I'd be happy to help! First, could you share your order number?"
- Bad: "Enter order number:"

### Include Confirmations

End workflows with a clear conclusion:

- "I've submitted your return request. You'll receive a confirmation email shortly."
- "Your account is all set up! Is there anything else you'd like to know?"

---

## Using Tools in Steps

You can attach a tool to any step. When the agent reaches that step:

1. Collects user input for required parameters
2. Executes the tool
3. Uses the result to continue the conversation

**Example:**
- Step: "What's your order number?"
- Tool: `getOrderDetails`
- Result: Agent looks up the order and can reference details in subsequent steps

---

## Example Workflow: Return Request

```
Name: Return Request
Description: Use when a customer wants to return or exchange a product they purchased

Steps:
1. "I can help you with your return. What's the order number for the item you'd like to return?"
2. "Thanks! Which item from this order would you like to return?" [Tool: getOrderDetails]
3. "Got it. What's the reason for the return?"
4. "I've submitted your return request. You'll receive a return shipping label at your email address within 24 hours. Is there anything else I can help with?" [Tool: createReturnRequest]
```

## Best Practices

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| Keep workflows focused on one task | Create overly long workflows |
| Write conversational step text | Use robotic language |
| Include confirmation at the end | Leave users wondering if it worked |
| Test with real scenarios | Deploy without testing |
| Use tools to validate information | Ask for info you could look up |

## Troubleshooting

### Workflow Not Triggering
- Check that the workflow is enabled
- Review the description — does it match what users are asking?
- Test with specific phrases in the Sandbox

### Users Getting Stuck
- Ensure step text is clear about what's expected
- Add helpful examples in step text
- Allow users to exit if the workflow doesn't fit their needs

### Tools Not Executing
- Verify the tool is enabled in Actions
- Check that required parameters are being collected
- Test the tool independently first
