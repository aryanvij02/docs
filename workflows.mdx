Workflows guide users through complex tasks with a structured sequence of steps.

## Examples

- **Onboarding** — Walk new users through setup
- **Returns** — Collect order number, reason, process request
- **Troubleshooting** — Diagnostic steps for common issues

## Create a Workflow

1. Go to [Actions](https://app.usecrow.ai/actions)
2. Click **Create Journey**
3. Fill in:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Name** | Short name (e.g., "Return Request") |
| **Description** | When to trigger (e.g., "Use when customer wants to return a product") |

4. Add steps:
   - Step text (what to ask/tell user)
   - Tool (optional—action to execute)

5. Save

## Example: Return Request

```
Step 1: "What's the order number for the item you'd like to return?"
Step 2: "Which item would you like to return?" [Tool: getOrderDetails]
Step 3: "What's the reason for the return?"
Step 4: "Done! You'll receive a return label within 24 hours." [Tool: createReturn]
```

## How It Works

1. User question matches workflow description
2. Agent starts the flow
3. User responds to each step
4. Optional tools execute at configured steps
5. Workflow completes

Users can exit anytime by asking something else.

## Tips

- Write clear descriptions so agent knows when to trigger
- Keep steps conversational, not robotic
- End with confirmation of what happened
- Test in Sandbox before deploying
